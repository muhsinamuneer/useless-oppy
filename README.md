## Project Description  
Oppy the Opposite Character is a fun, interactive web toy where a cute animated character (Oppy) always does the *opposite* of what you tell them. If you say “jump”, Oppy sits. If you say “smile”, Oppy frowns. It's designed for laughs, not logic.  

---

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)  
People obeying your commands on the internet? Too boring. We need someone who refuses to listen and does exactly the opposite — for *maximum chaos*.  

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)  
We built “Oppy,” an adorable yet stubborn digital friend who reacts in the most unexpected way possible. It’s useless, unproductive, and absolutely delightful.
